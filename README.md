# SDA-coursework
Coursework from the class "Data Structure and Algorithms." It is an analysis of three sorting algorithms. It was created as a practice exercise for working with dynamic memory allocation and sorting algorithms. Basically, it's not a product for commercial use or sale.
The main purpose was to practice the skills I had acquired. It also gave me insight into the speed of different sorting algorithms with various array shapes. I also practiced analytical and debugging skills. I overcame many difficulties and mistakes while working on this coursework, and I wanted to share my learning journey.
